## Overview

SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform developed by Microsoft. It's primarily used for document management and storage, acting as a secure place where teams can store, organize, share, and access information from almost any device.

### Key Functions of SharePoint

- **Intranets & Team Sites:** Serves as a centralized intranet and a secure digital space for team collaboration and internal communication.
- **Document Management:** Offers secure storage, version control, and organization for all documents and files.
- **Content & Data Tracking:** Allows users to create custom lists (e.g., tasks, contacts, issues) and manage company data.
- **Workflow Automation:** Enables the building of simple custom applications and forms to automate business processes.

The SharePoint connector uses OAuth 2.0 with Application Permissions via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), granting it the ability to execute background, server-to-server operations on SharePoint sites, lists, and documents without an interactive user sign-in.

## Configuration Setup

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Setup Guide" icon="gear">

### Step 1: Register Application in Azure Portal

**Sign in to Azure Portal:**
- Navigate to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Microsoft 365 administrator account

**Access App Registrations:**
- Search for "App registrations" in the top search bar
- Or navigate to Microsoft Entra ID → App registrations

**Create New Registration:**
- Enter application details:
  - **Name:** Enter app name (e.g., "PipesHub Connector")
  - **Supported account types:** Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)"
  - **Select a platform:** Web
  - **Redirect URI:** Leave blank
- Click "Register"

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/microsoft365/sharepoint/1.png"
    alt="SharePoint"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

<Note>
Single-tenant configuration ensures the application only works within your organization for better security.
</Note>

### Step 2: Copy Application Credentials

After registration, you'll see the Overview page. Copy the following values (you'll need these later):
- **Application (client) ID:** Found under "Essentials" section
- **Directory (tenant) ID:** Found under "Essentials" section

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/microsoft365/sharepoint/2.png"
    alt="SharePoint Application Credentials"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

<Warning>
Copy the "Application (client) ID" NOT the "Object ID". These are different values.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Configure API Permissions

**Configure Microsoft Graph Permissions:**
- On the overview page, click on **Manage > API Permissions**
- Click **Add a permission**
- Select **Microsoft Graph**
- Choose **Application permissions** (not Delegated permissions) and add the following:
  - `User.Read.All`
  - `GroupMember.Read.All`
  - `Group.Read.All`
  - `Files.ReadWrite.All`
  - `Reports.Read.All`
  - `Sites.FullControl.All`
  - `Member.Read.Hidden`

**Configure SharePoint Permissions:**
- Click **Add a permission** and select **SharePoint**
- Choose **Application permissions** and add the following:
  - `Sites.FullControl.All`
- Click **Add permissions**

### Step 4: Grant Admin Consent

- On the API permissions page, click **"Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]"**
- Confirm by clicking **"Yes"**
- Wait for the status to show green checkmarks

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/microsoft365/sharepoint/3.png"
    alt="SharePoint Admin Consent Page"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

<Note>
Admin consent is required for application permissions. Only Global Administrators or Application Administrators can grant this consent.
</Note>

### Step 5: Setup Certificate & Secret

**Install OpenSSL:**

OpenSSL is installed by default on Linux and OS X terminals. If you are using Windows, follow these instructions:

- Download the relevant OpenSSL installation manager for your version of Windows. OpenSSL offers a list of third-party binary distributions, with Shining Light Productions as an option.
- During the installation process, select the option to copy the OpenSSL binaries into the `/bin` directory.
- Open a new PowerShell instance. In PowerShell, you can run the following command to make use of OpenSSL binaries:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win64\\bin"
```

**Generate Certificate and Private Key:**

Run the following commands line by line. Microsoft SDK requires the certificate to be verified with a private key in PKCS#8 syntax:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out tempprivatekey.key 2048
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in tempprivatekey.key -out privatekey.key -nocrypt
openssl req -new -key privatekey.key -out request.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey privatekey.key -out certificate.crt
```

**Verify Certificate Files:**

Verify that both `certificate.crt` and `privatekey.key` exist. Open each file, and ensure the files conform to the following formats:

- The certificate file must start with `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and end with `END CERTIFICATE`
- The private key should begin with `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` and end with `END PRIVATE KEY`. It must not include RSA in the headers, nor be encrypted.

**Upload to PipesHub:**
- Upload the `certificate.crt` in PipesHub under **Client Certificate**
- Upload the `privatekey.key` in PipesHub under **Private Key**

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/microsoft365/sharepoint/4.png"
    alt="Uploading certificate and private key in PipesHub"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

**Upload Certificate to Azure:**
- Navigate back to **Microsoft Entra ID > Manage > App registrations** and click on the app you created earlier
- Click **Manage > Certificates & secrets**
- Click the **Certificates** section and **Upload certificate**
- Upload the `certificate.crt` file that you generated
- After uploading, the application must now list the new certificate

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/microsoft365/sharepoint/5.png"
    alt="Uploading certificate to Azure App"
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    width="90%"
  />
</div>

## One-Time Password (OTP)

Single-use codes sent via email for secure, passwordless authentication.

### How It Works

1. User enters their email address
2. System generates a one-time code and sends it to the user's email
3. User inputs the code to verify their identity
4. Upon validation, access is granted

### Configuration To enable OTP authentication:

1. Navigate to Authentication Settings
2. Toggle on "One-Time Password"
3. Ensure SMTP settings are properly configured

### Requirements - Functional SMTP configuration - Valid email addresses for all users

<Warning>
  OTP authentication requires proper SMTP configuration to deliver verification
  codes to users. For setting up Smtp, refer to [SMTP Configuration
  Guide](/smtp)
</Warning>

# External Services

Our architecture leverages several industry-standard external services to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient system. Below is an overview of each service and its role in our ecosystem.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. In our architecture, Kafka enables event-driven communication between services, making the system loosely coupled and highly scalable.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. We utilize MongoDB as our primary persistence layer for storing and retrieving application data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.

## etcd

etcd is a distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system. We use etcd for managing configuration across our services, ensuring consistency and availability of configuration parameters.

## ArangoDB

ArangoDB is a multi-model database supporting graph, document, and key-value data models. We leverage ArangoDB specifically for its graph database capabilities, enabling efficient storage and querying of connected data.

## Qdrant

Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine designed for production-ready AI applications. We use Qdrant as our vector database for efficient storage, management, and search of high-dimensional vectors for machine learning models and embeddings.

## Redis

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. In our architecture, Redis serves as a high-performance key-value store for caching and real-time data operations.

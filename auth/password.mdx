## Password Authentication

    Traditional username and password authentication for your application.
    ### How It Works
    1. Users enter their email address and password
    2. The system validates credentials against stored (hashed)
    passwords
    3. Upon successful validation, access is granted
    ### Configuration
    Password authentication is enabled by default. From the Authentication
    Settings page:
    1. Ensure "Password" is toggled on.

    <Info>
      Password that was used to login for the first time will be considered as default.
    </Info>

    ### Reset Password
    For resetting the password, user can go to the profile page and click on the change password option.

    <img src="/images/auth/reset_password.svg" alt="Reset password" width="90%" />

    Enter the current password and new password and click on update password.

    ### Forgot Password
    If a user forgets their password, SMTP configuration is necessary to enable the password reset functionality.

    How It Works

    1. Users click on the "Forgot Password" option.
    2. The system sends a password reset email via the configured SMTP server.
    3. The email contains a secure link redirecting the user to the password reset page.
    4. Users enter and confirm their new password.
    5. The system updates the password and grants access.

    ### For Smtp Configuration, refer to [SMTP Configuration Guide](/smtp).


    <Info>

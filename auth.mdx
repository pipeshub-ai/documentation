Our application supports multiple authentication methods to provide secure and flexible access for your users. This guide explains each authentication option, how to configure them, and best practices for implementation.

## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to your application. Selecting the right authentication method(s) depends on your organization's security requirements, user experience preferences, and existing infrastructure.

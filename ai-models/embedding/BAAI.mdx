## Usage in PipesHub

Simply select "Sentence Transformer" as your Provider and enter "BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5" in the Embedding Model field. This model is available as a default option for immediate use.

## When to Choose This Model

- When you need high-quality embeddings for English text
- For applications requiring state-of-the-art semantic search capabilities
- When you have adequate computational resources to handle a large model
- For enterprise-grade applications where embedding quality is critical

## Performance Considerations

While this model offers superior performance, it requires more computational resources than smaller alternatives like BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5. For resource-constrained environments, consider using the smaller variant, which still provides excellent results with faster processing.

Our application supports multiple authentication methods to provide secure and flexible access for your users. This guide explains each authentication option, how to configure them, and best practices for implementation.

## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to your application. Selecting the right authentication method(s) depends on your organization's security requirements, user experience preferences, and existing infrastructure.

## Available Authentication Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password">
    ## Password Authentication 
    Traditional username and password authentication for your application.
    ### How It Works 
    1. Users enter their email address and password 
    2. The system validates credentials against stored (hashed)
    passwords 
    3. Upon successful validation, access is granted 
    ### Configuration
    Password authentication is enabled by default. From the Authentication
    Settings page: 
    1. Ensure "Password" is toggled on.

    <Info>
      Password that was used to login for the first time will be considered as default.
    </Info>

    ### Reset Password
    For resetting the password, user can go to the profile page and click on the change password option.

    <img src="/images/auth/reset_password.svg" alt="Reset password" width="90%" />

    Enter the current password and new password and click on update password.

    ### Forgot Password
    If a user forgets their password, SMTP configuration is necessary to enable the password reset functionality.

    How It Works

    1. Users click on the "Forgot Password" option.
    2. The system sends a password reset email via the configured SMTP server.
    3. The email contains a secure link redirecting the user to the password reset page.
    4. Users enter and confirm their new password.
    5. The system updates the password and grants access.

    ### For Smtp Configuration, refer to [SMTP Configuration Guide](/smtp).


    <Info>
      Password authentication is the simplest to set up your app.
    </Info>

  </Tab>

<Tab title="One-Time Password">

## One-Time Password (OTP)

Single-use codes sent via email for secure, passwordless authentication.

### How It Works

1. User enters their email address
2. System generates a one-time code and sends it to the user's email
3. User inputs the code to verify their identity
4. Upon validation, access is granted

### Configuration To enable OTP authentication:

1. Navigate to Authentication Settings
2. Toggle on "One-Time Password"
3. Ensure SMTP settings are properly configured

### Requirements - Functional SMTP configuration - Valid email addresses for all users

  <Warning>
    OTP authentication requires proper SMTP configuration to deliver
    verification codes to users. For setting up Smtp, refer to [SMTP
    Configuration Guide](/smtp)
  </Warning>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Google">

## Google Authentication Allow users to sign in with their Google accounts using OAuth 2.0.

### How It Works

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. User is redirected to Google's authentication page
3. After authenticating with Google, user is returned to the application
4. Upon successful validation, access is granted

### Configuration To enable Google authentication:

1. Create OAuth credentials in [Google Cloud Console]() Google Cloud Console: - Create a project (if you don't have one) - Configure
   OAuth consent screen - Create OAuth client ID (Web application) - Note your Client ID and Client Secret
2. In your application: - Navigate to
   Authentication Settings - Toggle on "Google" - Enter Client ID - Configure redirect URI (typically your-app-url/auth/google/callback)- Click "Save"
   <Warning>
     Redirect Uri in you Google Cloud Console should match exactly with the
     (your-app-url/auth/google/callback)
     <Info>
       For example - if your app is running on localhost:3001 then redirectUri
       should be http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback in Google Cloud
       Console.
     </Info>
   </Warning>

<Tab title="Microsoft">
  ## Microsoft Authentication Allow users to sign in with their Microsoft
  accounts using OAuth 2.0. ### How It Works 1. User clicks "Sign in with
  Microsoft" 2. User is redirected to Microsoft's authentication page 3. After
  authenticating with Microsoft, user is returned to your application 4. System
  validates the Microsoft authentication token 5. Upon successful validation,
  access is granted ### Configuration To enable Microsoft authentication: 1.
  Register your application in the Microsoft Azure portal: - Sign in to the
  Azure portal - Navigate to Azure Active Directory - Register a new application
  - Configure platform settings (Web) - Note your Application (client) ID and
  Client Secret 2. In your application: - Navigate to Authentication Settings -
  Toggle on "Microsoft" - Enter Client ID and Client Secret - Configure redirect
  URI (typically your-app-url/auth/microsoft/callback) - Click "Save" ### Best
  Practices - Implement proper session management - Use state parameters to
  prevent CSRF attacks - Validate all tokens server-side
  <Info>
    Microsoft authentication works well for organizations using Microsoft 365 or
    with an existing Microsoft identity infrastructure.
  </Info>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Azure AD">
  ## Azure Active Directory (AD) Enterprise authentication using Microsoft's
  Azure Active Directory. ### How It Works 1. User clicks "Sign in with Azure
  AD" 2. User is redirected to their organization's Azure AD login page 3. After
  authenticating, user is returned to your application 4. System validates the
  Azure AD authentication token 5. Upon successful validation, access is granted
  ### Configuration To enable Azure AD authentication: 1. Register your
  application in the Azure portal: - Sign in to the Azure portal - Navigate to
  Azure Active Directory - Register a new application - Configure platform
  settings (Web) - Note your Application (client) ID and Tenant ID - Create a
  Client Secret 2. In your application: - Navigate to Authentication Settings -
  Toggle on "Azure AD" - Enter Application ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret -
  Configure redirect URI - Set up required permissions and optional claims -
  Click "Not Configured" to change status to "Configured" ### Enterprise
  Features - Group-based access control - Multi-factor authentication
  integration - Conditional access policies - Enterprise audit logs
  <Info>
    Azure AD is ideal for enterprise scenarios where centralized identity
    management is required.
  </Info>
</Tab>

  <Tab title="SAML SSO">
    ## SAML SSO Enterprise single sign-on using Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML) protocol.
    ### How It Works 
    1. User attempts to access your application 
    2. System redirects to the Identity Provider (IdP) 3. User
    authenticates with the IdP 4. IdP generates a SAML assertion (token) 5. User
    is redirected back to your application with the SAML assertion 6. System
    validates the SAML assertion 7. Upon successful validation, access is
    granted ### Configuration To enable SAML SSO: 1. Gather information about
    your application (Service Provider): - Generate or obtain a Certificate and
    Private Key - Determine Entity ID (usually your application URL) - Determine
    Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL 2. Register your application with your
    Identity Provider: - Upload certificate - Configure SAML attributes and
    mappings - Note the IdP metadata URL or download metadata XML 3. In your
    application: - Navigate to Authentication Settings - Toggle on "SAML SSO" -
    Enter Entity ID and Single Sign-On URL from IdP - Upload IdP Certificate -
    Configure attribute mappings - Click "Not Configured" to change status to
    "Configured" ### Enterprise Features - Works with most major Identity
    Providers (Okta, OneLogin, etc.) - Attribute-based access control -
    Just-in-time user provisioning - Session management
    <Warning>
      SAML configuration requires technical coordination between your
      application admin and the Identity Provider admin.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

If users encounter authentication issues:

1. Verify the authentication method configuration
2. Check server logs for specific error messages
3. Confirm network connectivity to identity providers
4. Validate certificate expiration dates
5. Test authentication flow with a test account

## Microsoft Authentication Allow users to sign in with their Microsoft

accounts using OAuth 2.0. ### How It Works 1. User clicks "Sign in with
Microsoft" 2. User is redirected to Microsoft's authentication page 3. After
authenticating with Microsoft, user is returned to your application 4. System
validates the Microsoft authentication token 5. Upon successful validation,
access is granted ### Configuration To enable Microsoft authentication: 1.
Register your application in the Microsoft Azure portal: - Sign in to the
Azure portal - Navigate to Azure Active Directory - Register a new application

- Configure platform settings (Web) - Note your Application (client) ID and
  Client Secret 2. In your application: - Navigate to Authentication Settings -
  Toggle on "Microsoft" - Enter Client ID and Client Secret - Configure redirect
  URI (typically your-app-url/auth/microsoft/callback) - Click "Save" ### Best
  Practices - Implement proper session management - Use state parameters to
  prevent CSRF attacks - Validate all tokens server-side
  <Info>
    Microsoft authentication works well for organizations using Microsoft 365 or
    with an existing Microsoft identity infrastructure.

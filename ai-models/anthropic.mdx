# Anthropic Configuration

![Anthropic Configuration Interface](/images/ai-models/Anthropic_LLMConfig.png)

*The Anthropic configuration screen in PipesHub where you'll enter your API Key and Model Name*

PipesHub allows you to integrate with Anthropic's Claude models to enable powerful AI features in your workspace, providing sophisticated natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Required Fields

### API Key *

The Anthropic API Key is required to authenticate your requests to Anthropic's services.

**How to obtain an API Key:**
1. Log in to your [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key immediately (it will only be shown once)

**Security Note:** Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to Anthropic.

### Model Name *

The Model Name field defines which Anthropic Claude model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Popular Anthropic models include:**
- `claude-3-5-sonnet` - Latest and most capable Claude model
- `claude-3-opus` - Most powerful model for complex reasoning
- `claude-3-haiku` - Fastest model with lower latency

**How to choose a model:**
- For complex reasoning and advanced features, select `claude-3-5-sonnet` or `claude-3-opus`
- For routine tasks and lower latency, select `claude-3-haiku`
- Check Anthropic's [model documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview) for the most up-to-date options

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "Anthropic" as your Provider from the dropdown
2. Enter your Anthropic API Key in the designated field (marked with *)
3. Specify your desired Model Name (marked with *)
4. Click "Continue" to proceed with setup

``Both the API Key and Model Name are required fields to successfully configure Anthropic integration. You must complete these fields to proceed with the setup.``

## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your Anthropic account's quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check Anthropic's pricing page for details
- Model capabilities vary - more powerful models may provide better results but at higher cost
- Claude models excel at:
  - Nuanced content generation
  - Detailed reasoning
  - Following complex instructions
  - Maintaining consistency in long conversations

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your Anthropic account has billing set up if you're using paid models
- Check that the model name is spelled correctly and matches Anthropic's naming conventions
- Verify that your account has access to the model you've selected

PipesHub allows you to integrate with Mistral AI to enable sophisticated AI features in your workspace, accessing Mistral's powerful large language models with advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Required Fields

### API Key *

The API Key is required to authenticate your requests to Mistral AI services.

### Model Name *

The Model Name field defines which Mistral AI model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Popular Mistral AI models include:**
- `mistral-large-2512` - **Mistral Large 3**: State-of-the-art, open-weight, general-purpose multimodal model with a granular Mixture-of-Experts architecture. It features 41B active parameters and 675B total parameters.
- `mistral-medium-2508` - **Mistral Medium 3.1**: Frontier-class multimodal model released August 2025. Improving tone and performance.
- `mistral-small-2506` - **Mistral Small 3.2**: An update to the previous small model, released June 2025.

**How to choose a model:**
- For complex reasoning and maximum capabilities, select `mistral-large-2512`

## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your Mistral AI API quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check Mistral AI's pricing page for details
- Model capabilities vary - more powerful models may provide better results but at higher cost

  - Multimodal understanding (text and images)
  - Support for long contexts (up to 128K tokens)
  - Open-weight models for transparency and flexibility
  - State-of-the-art performance across various tasks

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your Mistral AI account has billing set up if you're using paid service tiers
- Check that the model name is spelled correctly and available
- Verify that your API key has access to the specific model you've selected
- If you're experiencing rate limits, check your API usage in the Mistral AI Console dashboard
- For multimodal features, ensure your model supports image inputs

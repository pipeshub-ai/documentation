## Overview

Azure Blob Storage is a massively scalable **object storage** service for unstructured data. It is organized into storage accounts, containers, and blobs and is commonly used for documents, media, backups, and application data.

The Azure Blob connector enables you to sync blobs and virtual folders from your Azure Storage account into PipesHub, making your content searchable through AI-powered search and easily accessible across your organization.

### Azure Blob Data Structure

The connector understands Azure Blob Storage's logical hierarchy:

**Storage Account → Containers → Virtual Folders → Blobs**

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Storage Account** | Top-level Azure resource that owns one or more blob containers |
| **Containers** | Logical groupings of blobs within a storage account |
| **Virtual Folders** | Prefix-based paths inside containers (e.g., `documents/reports/`) |
| **Blobs** | Individual objects (files) stored in containers with unique names (paths) |

### What Gets Synced

The connector indexes the following content for AI-powered search:

- **Blobs**: All supported file types stored in selected containers (documents, images, archives, etc.)
- **Virtual Folders**: Directory-like structure inferred from blob paths
- **Metadata**: Blob names, sizes, modification dates, MIME types
- **Permissions**: Access scope (Personal vs Team) controlled via connector configuration

## Configuration Guide

<AccordionGroup type="single" collapsible>

<Accordion title="Setup">

<div className="mt-4">

### Setup Overview

The Azure Blob connector uses an **Azure Storage connection string** from the Azure Portal. It syncs containers, virtual folders, and blobs, enabling comprehensive search and access across your Azure content.

### Authentication

The connector uses **Connection String authentication**:

- Connection string is generated from your Azure Storage account
- Contains account name, key, and endpoint
- Stored securely in PipesHub as a secret

<Info>
  Connection strings provide full access to your storage account. Treat them like passwords and store them securely. Rotate keys regularly following Azure security best practices.
</Info>

### How to configure and enable the Azure Blob Connector

### Step 1: Get the Azure Storage Connection String

1. **Sign in to Azure Portal:**  
   Go to `https://portal.azure.com` and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Open your Storage Account:**
   - In the left navigation, select **"Storage accounts"**
   - Click the storage account you want PipesHub to use

3. **Navigate to Access Keys:**
   - In the storage account menu, go to **"Security + networking" → "Access keys"** (or **"Access keys"** section)

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/storage_account_access_keys.png"
    alt="Azure Storage Account Access Keys"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

4. **Copy the Connection String:**
   - Under **key1** (or key2), click **"Show"** to reveal the connection string
   - Click **"Copy"** next to **Connection string**
   - Keep this value secure – you will paste it into PipesHub

<Warning>
  <div className="text-lg font-semibold">
    Do not share your connection string publicly or commit it to version control. Anyone with this string can access your storage account.
  </div>
</Warning>

### Step 2: Configure Connector in PipesHub

1. **Navigate to Connectors:**
   - In PipesHub, go to **Settings → Connectors**
   - Find the **Azure Blob Storage** connector in the list
   - Click **"Configure"**

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/azure_blob_config.png"
    alt="PipesHub Azure Blob Configuration"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

2. **Enter Connection String:**
   - In the **Connection String** field, paste the connection string you copied from Azure Portal
   - Click **"Save Auth Settings"** or **"Next"**

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/connection_string.png"
    alt="Azure Blob Connection String Input"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

<Warning>
  Ensure the connection string is complete and copied without extra spaces. Invalid or partial values will cause authentication failures.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Configure Sync Settings

1. **Choose Sync Strategy:**
   - **Scheduled**: Automatically sync at regular intervals (recommended)
   - **Manual**: Sync only when triggered manually

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/sync_strategy.png"
    alt="Azure Blob Sync Strategy"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

2. **Set Sync Interval (if Scheduled):**
   - Choose how often to sync (e.g., 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours)
   - Default is typically 60 minutes

<Info>
  More frequent syncs keep your data fresher but use more Azure API and PipesHub resources. For large storage accounts, consider longer intervals.
</Info>

### Step 4: Configure Filters (Optional)

Filters control which data is **synced** and which data is **indexed** for search.

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/azure_blob_filters.png"
    alt="Azure Blob Filters Configuration"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

#### Sync Filters

Sync filters decide what content is downloaded from Azure Blob Storage. Data excluded by sync filters is never fetched.

**Available Sync Filters:**

1. **Container Names**
   - **Operator**: `In` (include only) or `Not In` (exclude)
   - **Selection**: Choose from a **searchable dropdown** of containers in your storage account
   - Select one or more containers to scope the sync

2. **File Extensions**
   - **Operator**: `In` (include) or `Not In` (exclude)
   - **Value**: Comma-separated list of extensions, e.g. `pdf, docx, txt`
   - Case-insensitive; do not include leading dots

3. **Modified Date**
   - **Operators**: `Is After`, `Is Before`, `Is Between`
   - Use to sync only recently updated blobs (e.g., last 6 months)

4. **Created Date**
   - **Operators**: `Is After`, `Is Before`, `Is Between`
   - Use to include or exclude older blobs based on creation time

#### Indexing Filters

Indexing filters control what synced data is processed for AI-powered search.

- **Index Files** (default: enabled) – Include blob content in search
- **Index Folders** (default: enabled) – Include virtual folder structure in search

**Example Configurations:**

- **Sync only certain containers**: Container Names → `In` → select containers
- **Documents only**: File Extensions → `In` → `pdf, docx, txt, pptx`
- **Exclude media**: File Extensions → `Not In` → `jpg, png, mp4, mov`
- **Recent blobs only**: Modified Date → `Is After` → `YYYY-MM-DD`

<Info>
  Filters can be changed anytime. Updates take effect on the next sync.
</Info>

### Step 5: Enable the Connector

1. After configuration, toggle the connector status to **"Enable"**
2. Use the toggle switch or **"Enable"** button in the connector panel

<div className="text-center">
  <img
    src="/images/connectors/azure-blob/enable_connector.png"
    alt="Enable Azure Blob Connector"
    className="block mx-auto w-11/12"
  />
</div>

3. PipesHub will validate your connection string and start the initial sync
4. Wait until the connector status shows **"Active"** or **"Syncing"**
5. Use the **Indexing Progress** panel to monitor sync status

</div>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Features and Behavior">

<div className="mt-4">

### Supported Features

The Azure Blob connector syncs:

- **Containers** as top-level record groups
- **Blobs** (files) with metadata such as name, size, last modified time, MIME type
/- **Virtual Folders** inferred from blob paths (e.g., `folder/subfolder/file.txt`)
- **Permissions** via connector scope (Personal vs Team)

### Data Sync Behavior

#### Initial Sync

The first sync scans the selected containers:

- Discovers containers and creates corresponding record groups in PipesHub
- Lists blobs within each container using Azure Blob pagination
- Extracts metadata and builds a folder hierarchy from blob paths
- Indexes supported blob content for AI-powered search

<Info>
  Use container and file extension filters to significantly reduce initial sync time, especially for large storage accounts.
</Info>

#### Incremental Sync

Subsequent syncs are incremental:

- Uses blob timestamps to fetch only new or updated blobs
- Tracks sync points per container to avoid reprocessing unchanged data
- Handles deletions by marking records as deleted and removing them from search results

### Permission Handling

The connector respects Azure security and PipesHub scopes:

- **Azure-level permissions**: Connector can only access containers and blobs allowed by the connection string
- **PipesHub scopes**:
  - **Personal**: Only the connector creator can see synced content
  - **Team**: All organization users have read access to synced content
- **Permission inheritance**: Blobs inherit access from their container and connector scope

### Sync Frequency

**Scheduled Sync:**
- Default: ~60 minutes
- Options: 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours

**Manual Sync:**
- Triggered from the connector UI
- Recommended for testing or after large content changes

<Info>
  For very large storage accounts or infrequently updated content, prefer less frequent syncs (4–24 hours) to optimize cost and performance.
</Info>

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup type="single" collapsible>

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting" icon="circle-exclamation">

**Invalid connection string:**

*Symptoms:*
- Error messages like "Authentication failed" or "Invalid connection string"
- Connector fails to initialize

*Solutions:*
1. Verify the connection string is copied completely from Azure Portal
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or line breaks
3. Regenerate and replace the access keys if they may have been rotated
4. Confirm that the storage account is active and not deleted

**Access denied or missing containers:**

*Symptoms:*
- Some containers do not appear in the container filter
- Sync fails with permission-related errors

*Solutions:*
1. Confirm you are using a connection string with correct permissions
2. Check container-level access policies in Azure Portal
3. Ensure the storage account is in the correct subscription and region

**No data syncing:**

*Symptoms:*
- Connector shows "Active" but no blobs or folders appear
- Indexing progress remains at 0%

*Solutions:*
1. Check that at least one container is selected in filters
2. Verify file extension filters are not excluding all relevant file types
3. Confirm date filters are not set too restrictively
4. Validate that blobs actually exist in the selected containers

**Sync taking too long:**

*Symptoms:*
- Initial sync runs for many hours
- Progress appears slow for very large containers

*Solutions:*
1. Use container filters to limit scope
2. Restrict file extensions to document-heavy types (e.g., `pdf, docx, txt`)
3. Use date filters to focus on recent content
4. Increase sync interval for large storage accounts

**Blobs not appearing in search:**

*Symptoms:*
- Blobs are visible in connector records, but not searchable

*Solutions:*
1. Ensure **Index Files** is enabled in indexing filters
2. Confirm the file type is text-based and supported for indexing
3. Check that files are not encrypted or password-protected
4. Allow time for indexing to complete, especially for large files

### FAQ

<AccordionGroup type="single" collapsible>

<Accordion title="How long does the initial sync take?">
  Sync time depends on the number and size of blobs:
  
  | Storage Size | Estimated Time |
  |--------------|----------------|
  | Small (< 1,000 blobs) | 5–15 minutes |
  | Medium (1,000–10,000 blobs) | 15–60 minutes |
  | Large (10,000–100,000 blobs) | 1–3 hours |
  | Very Large (100,000–1,000,000 blobs) | 3–8+ hours |
  
  Use container and extension filters to reduce initial sync time dramatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I connect multiple storage accounts?">
  **Yes.** Create one Azure Blob connector instance per storage account.  
  Each instance uses its own connection string and filter configuration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What file types can be indexed for search?">
  Text-based and document formats are indexed, including:
  
  - Documents: PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, ODT, RTF  
  - Text: TXT, MD, CSV, JSON, XML, HTML  
  - Code files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`)
  
  Binary-only formats (images, videos, archives) are synced and visible but their contents are not searchable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I delete a blob in Azure?">
  Deletions are detected during the next incremental sync:
  
  - The record is marked as deleted in PipesHub  
  - The blob is removed from search results  
  - Historical behavior depends on your organization's retention policies

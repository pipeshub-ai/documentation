# OpenAI Configuration

![OpenAI Configuration Interface](/images/ai-models/OpenAI_LLMConfig.png)

*The OpenAI configuration screen in PipesHub where you'll enter your API Key and Model Name*

PipesHub allows you to integrate with OpenAI's powerful language models to enable AI features in your workspace.

## Required Fields

### API Key

The OpenAI API Key is required to authenticate your requests to OpenAI's services.

**How to obtain an API Key:**
1. Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Create a new secret key
4. Copy the key immediately (it will only be shown once)

**Security Note:** Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to OpenAI.

### Model Name

The Model Name field defines which OpenAI model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Popular OpenAI models include:**
- `gpt-4.1` - OpenAI's flagship model for complex tasks. It is well suited for problem solving across domains.
- `gpt-4o` - Powerful model balancing cost and capability.
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Faster, more cost-effective option for many use cases.

**How to choose a model:**
- For complex reasoning and advanced features, select `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4-turbo`
- For routine tasks and lower latency, select `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Check OpenAI's [model documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for the most up-to-date options

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "OpenAI" as your Provider from the dropdown
2. Enter your OpenAI API Key in the designated field (marked with *)
3. Specify your desired Model Name (marked with *)
4. Click "Continue" to proceed with setup

``The system configuration interface clearly indicates which fields are required with an asterisk (*). Both the API Key and Model Name are required fields to successfully configure OpenAI integration.
``
## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your OpenAI account's quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check OpenAI's pricing page for details
- Model capabilities vary - more powerful models may provide better results but at higher cost

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your OpenAI account has billing set up if you're using paid models
- Check that the model name is spelled correctly and is available on your OpenAI account tier

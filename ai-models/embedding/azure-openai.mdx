# Azure OpenAI Embeddings Configuration

PipesHub allows you to integrate with Azure OpenAI's powerful embedding models to enable vector search, semantic similarity, and other AI features in your workspace.

## Required Fields

### Endpoint *

The Azure OpenAI Endpoint is required to connect to your specific Azure OpenAI resource.

**How to obtain your Endpoint:**
1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource
3. In the Overview section, find and copy the Endpoint URL
4. The endpoint typically follows this format: `https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/`

**Note:** The endpoint is specific to your Azure deployment region and resource.

### API Key *

The API Key is required to authenticate your requests to your Azure OpenAI resource.

**How to obtain an API Key:**
1. In the Azure Portal, go to your Azure OpenAI resource
2. Navigate to "Keys and Endpoint" under Resource Management
3. Copy either Key 1 or Key 2 (both will work)

**Security Note:** Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to Azure OpenAI.

### Embedding Model *

The Embedding Model field defines which Azure OpenAI embedding model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Available Azure OpenAI embedding models:**
- `text-embedding-3-small` - Newer model with excellent performance for most use cases
- `text-embedding-3-large` - Higher dimensional embeddings for tasks requiring maximum accuracy

**Note:** Availability depends on which models you have deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource.

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "Azure OpenAI" as your Provider from the dropdown
2. Enter your Azure OpenAI Endpoint in the designated field (marked with *)
3. Enter your Azure OpenAI API Key in the designated field (marked with *)
4. Specify your desired Embedding Model (marked with *)
5. Click "Continue" to proceed with setup

The system configuration interface clearly indicates which fields are required with an asterisk (*). All three fields (Endpoint, API Key, and Embedding Model) are required to successfully configure Azure OpenAI embedding integration.

## Model Deployment

Before you can use a specific embedding model in Azure OpenAI, you must first deploy it:

1. Go to your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal
2. Select "Model Deployments" from the left menu
3. Click "Create New Deployment"
4. Select your desired embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`)
5. Provide a deployment name
6. Set your desired capacity

The deployment name is what you'll use as your Embedding Model value in the PipesHub configuration.

## Model Specifications

| Model | Dimensions | Tokens | Performance | Cost |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | 8191 | Very High | Medium |
| text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | 8191 | Highest | Higher |

## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your Azure OpenAI resource's quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check Azure OpenAI pricing page for details
- Consider your Azure resource capacity when configuring embedding models
- Regional availability may vary for different embedding models
- Azure OpenAI provides additional security, compliance, and data residency options

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key and endpoint are correct
- Ensure your embedding model is properly deployed in your Azure OpenAI resource
- Check that your Azure subscription is active and has sufficient quota
- Verify network connectivity and firewall settings if using private endpoints
- Ensure the specified model name matches exactly with your deployment name

## Deployment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the minimum system requirements to run PipesHub?">
    To ensure optimal performance, we recommend the following minimum specifications:
    - **RAM**: 16 GB or more
    - **CPU Cores**: 4 cores or more
    
    These requirements ensure smooth operation of PipesHub and its various components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I consider when deploying PipesHub's Docker image to the cloud?">
    When deploying PipesHub to cloud platforms, keep these important points in mind:
    
    - **Always use HTTPS**: Ensure your deployment uses HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication
    - **Port Configuration**: Redirect incoming traffic to `localhost:3000` where PipesHub runs
    - **Using EC2 or VM instances**: If you're deploying on EC2 or other virtual machines, you can use NGINX as a reverse proxy to handle HTTPS termination and route traffic to your application
    
    This setup ensures your deployment is secure and properly configured for production use.

## AI Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does PipesHub support OpenAI-compatible endpoints for AI and embedding models?">
    Yes, PipesHub fully supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints. You can configure any provider that offers OpenAI-compatible endpoints in two ways:
    - During the initial onboarding process
    - By updating your settings after installation
    
    This flexibility allows you to use your preferred AI provider while maintaining compatibility with the OpenAI API standard.

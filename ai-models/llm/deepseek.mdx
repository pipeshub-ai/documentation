# DeepSeek Configuration

![OpenAI Compatible Configuration Interface](/images/ai-models/OpenAICompatible_LLMConfig.png)

*The OpenAI API Compatible configuration screen in PipesHub where you'll enter your DeepSeek endpoint URL, API Key, and Model Name*

PipesHub allows you to integrate with DeepSeek AI models using their OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. DeepSeek offers powerful AI models with advanced reasoning capabilities, making it ideal for complex problem-solving tasks.

## What is DeepSeek?

DeepSeek is an AI research company that develops advanced language models with enhanced reasoning capabilities. Their models are designed for:
- Complex problem-solving and analytical tasks
- Advanced reasoning and logical thinking
- Mathematical and scientific computations
- Code generation and analysis
- Multi-step reasoning workflows

## Prerequisites

Before configuring DeepSeek in PipesHub, ensure you have:
1. A DeepSeek account at [https://platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. An active API key from the DeepSeek platform
3. Sufficient API credits or an active subscription

## Required Fields

### Endpoint URL *

The Endpoint URL for DeepSeek's API service.

**DeepSeek API Endpoint:**
```
https://api.deepseek.com/v1/
```

**Important:** 
- The endpoint URL must include the `/v1/` suffix
- DeepSeek uses HTTPS for secure communication
- The endpoint is globally accessible

### API Key *

The API Key is required to authenticate your requests to DeepSeek's services.

**How to obtain a DeepSeek API Key:**
1. Visit [https://platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to the API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key immediately (it's only shown once)

**Security Note:** Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to DeepSeek.

### Model Name *

The Model Name specifies which DeepSeek model you want to use.

**Available DeepSeek Models:**
- `deepseek-chat` - General-purpose conversational model
- `deepseek-reasoner` - Enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex tasks

**Recommended for most use cases:**
```
deepseek-chat
```

**For advanced reasoning tasks:**
```
deepseek-reasoner
```

**Important:** Verify the exact model name from the [DeepSeek documentation](https://platform.deepseek.com/docs) as model names may be updated.

## Optional Features

### Multimodal

DeepSeek's current models primarily focus on text-based tasks.

**When to enable:**
- Only if using a DeepSeek model that explicitly supports vision/image understanding
- Check the [DeepSeek documentation](https://platform.deepseek.com/docs) to confirm multimodal support for your chosen model

**Note:** As of now, most DeepSeek models are text-focused. Leave this unchecked unless you're certain your model supports multimodal input.

### Reasoning

Enable this checkbox when using DeepSeek's reasoning-focused models.

**When to enable:**
- You're using `deepseek-reasoner` or similar reasoning-focused models
- Your use case involves complex problem-solving
- You need advanced mathematical, logical, or analytical capabilities
- Your tasks require multi-step reasoning processes

**Note:** Reasoning models take longer to generate responses as they perform additional internal reasoning steps before providing answers.

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "OpenAI API Compatible" as your Provider Type from the dropdown
2. Enter the DeepSeek Endpoint URL: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/`
3. Enter your DeepSeek API Key
4. Specify the Model Name (e.g., `deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner`)
5. (Optional) Check "Multimodal" if your model supports image input
6. (Optional) Check "Reasoning" if using a reasoning-focused model
7. Click "Add Model" to complete the setup

**All fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required to successfully configure the DeepSeek integration. You must complete these fields to proceed with the setup.**

## Supported Models

DeepSeek offers several model variants optimized for different use cases:

- **deepseek-chat** - General-purpose conversational AI with strong performance across various tasks
- **deepseek-reasoner** - Specialized model with enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex problem-solving

For the most up-to-date list of available models and their capabilities, refer to the [DeepSeek documentation](https://platform.deepseek.com/docs).

## Usage Considerations

- API usage counts against your DeepSeek account quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing structures
- Check your account balance and rate limits regularly
- Reasoning models may have higher latency due to their enhanced thinking process
- Context window sizes vary by model - verify limits for your use case

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify the endpoint URL is correct: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/`
- Ensure you have internet connectivity
- Check if DeepSeek's services are operational

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your API key has been properly copied without extra spaces
- Check that your DeepSeek account has sufficient credits
- Confirm your account is in good standing

**Model Not Found:**
- Verify the model name is spelled correctly (e.g., `deepseek-chat`)
- Check that the model is available in your region
- Ensure your account has access to the specified model
- Refer to the latest DeepSeek documentation for current model names

**Rate Limiting:**
- Check your account's rate limits in the DeepSeek dashboard
- Consider upgrading your plan if you frequently hit rate limits
- Implement appropriate retry logic in your application

**Response Errors:**
- Ensure the selected model is currently available
- Verify that multimodal/reasoning flags match the model's capabilities
- Check the DeepSeek status page for any ongoing issues

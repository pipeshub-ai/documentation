## Overview

The Google Workspace connector allows you to access, manage, and synchronize data across Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive.

Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) is a collection of cloud computing, productivity, and collaboration tools developed by Google. This connector provides access to core Google Workspace services through a unified API.

### Authentication

The Google Workspace connector uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This requires users to grant permission for the application to access their Google Workspace data within the scopes specified.

## How to configure and enable the Google Workspace Connector

### Obtaining credentials

1. To obtain service credentials for a Google Workspace connector, you need to create a service account in the Google Cloud Console, assign it the necessary roles, and then download the service account key as a JSON file.
2. Access the Google Cloud Console: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   Sign in with an administrator account for your Google Workspace domain.
3. Navigate to Service Accounts:
   In the Google Cloud console, go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
4. Create a Service Account. Generate a Key. Choose "JSON" as the key type and click "Create".
   A JSON file containing the private key will be downloaded to your computer.
   Important: Store this JSON file securely, as it's the only copy of the private key.

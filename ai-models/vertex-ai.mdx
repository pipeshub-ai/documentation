*The Google Vertex AI configuration screen in PipesHub where you'll enter your API Key and Model Name*

PipesHub allows you to integrate with Google's Vertex AI platform to enable sophisticated AI features in your workspace, with access to Google's powerful Gemini models.

## Required Fields

### API Key *

The API Key is required to authenticate your requests to Google's Vertex AI services.

**How to obtain an API Key:**
1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create or select a Google Cloud project
3. Enable the Vertex AI API for your project
4. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
5. Click "Create credentials" and select "API key"
6. Copy the generated API key

**Security Note:** Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to Google Vertex AI services.

### Model Name *

The Model Name field defines which Google Vertex AI model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Popular Google Vertex AI models include:**
- `gemini-1.5-pro` - Most advanced model with strong reasoning abilities
- `gemini-1.5-flash` - Faster model with good performance for most tasks
- `gemini-1.0-pro` - Earlier version with comprehensive capabilities

**How to choose a model:**
- For complex reasoning and advanced features, select `gemini-1.5-pro`
- For routine tasks and lower latency, select `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Check Google's [Vertex AI model documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/models) for the most up-to-date options

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "Gemini" as your Provider from the dropdown
2. Enter your Google Cloud API Key in the designated field (marked with *)
3. Specify your desired Model Name (marked with *)
4. Click "Continue" to proceed with setup

``Both the API Key and Model Name are required fields to successfully configure Google Vertex 
AI integration. You must complete these fields to proceed with the setup.``


## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your Google Cloud project's quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check Google Cloud's pricing page for details
- Model capabilities vary - more powerful models may provide better results but at higher cost
- Google Vertex AI provides:
  - Deep integration with other Google Cloud services
  - Enterprise-grade security and compliance
  - Scalable performance for production workloads
  - Regional availability to meet data residency requirements

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your Google Cloud project has billing enabled
- Check that the Vertex AI API is properly enabled for your project
- Verify that the model name is spelled correctly and available in your region
- Ensure your Google Cloud project has sufficient quota for the selected model

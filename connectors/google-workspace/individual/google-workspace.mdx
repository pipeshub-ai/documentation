## Overview

The Google Workspace connector allows you to access, manage, and synchronize data across Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive.

Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) is a collection of cloud computing, productivity, and collaboration tools developed by Google. This connector provides access to core Google Workspace services through a unified API.

### Authentication

The Google Workspace connector uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This requires users to grant permission for the application to access their Google Workspace data within the scopes specified.

3. Create a project (if you don't have one) - Configure
   OAuth consent screen - Create OAuth client ID (Web application) - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

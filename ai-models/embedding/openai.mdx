# OpenAI Embeddings Configuration

![OpenAI Embeddings Configuration Interface](/images/ai-models/OpenAI_EmbeddingConfig.png)

*The OpenAI embeddings configuration screen in PipesHub where you'll enter your API Key and Embedding Model*

PipesHub allows you to integrate with OpenAI's powerful embedding models to enable vector search, semantic similarity, and other AI features in your workspace.

## Required Fields

### API Key

The OpenAI API Key is required to authenticate your requests to OpenAI's embedding services.

**How to obtain an API Key:**
1. Log in to your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Create a new secret key
4. Copy the key immediately (it will only be shown once)

**Security Note:** Your API key should be kept secure and never shared publicly. PipesHub securely stores your API key and uses it only for authenticating requests to OpenAI.

### Embedding Model

The Embedding Model field defines which OpenAI embedding model you want to use with PipesHub.

**Available OpenAI embedding models:**
- `text-embedding-3-small` - Cost-effective model with excellent performance for most use cases
- `text-embedding-3-large` - Higher dimensional embeddings for tasks requiring maximum accuracy

**How to choose an embedding model:**
- For most applications and cost efficiency, select `text-embedding-3-small`
- For specialized applications requiring maximum performance, select `text-embedding-3-large`
- Check OpenAI's [embedding documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for the most up-to-date options

## Configuration Steps

As shown in the image above:

1. Select "OpenAI" as your Embedding Provider from the dropdown
2. Enter your OpenAI API Key in the designated field (marked with *)
3. Specify your desired Embedding Model (marked with *)
4. Click "Continue" to proceed with setup

The system configuration interface clearly indicates which fields are required with an asterisk (*). Both the API Key and Embedding Model are required fields to successfully configure OpenAI embedding integration.

## Model Specifications

| Model | Dimensions | Tokens | Performance | Cost |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|------|
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536 | 8191 | Very High | Lower |
| text-embedding-3-large | 3072 | 8191 | Highest | Higher |

## Advanced Parameters

OpenAI's embedding models support parameters to control the output:

- **Dimensions** - Control the size of embedding vectors (smaller dimensions = smaller storage requirements)
- **Encoding Format** - Choose between "float" and "base64" for different precision and size tradeoffs

## Usage Considerations

- API usage will count against your OpenAI account's quota and billing
- Different models have different pricing - check OpenAI's pricing page for details
- Embedding models are optimized for different languages and use cases
- Consider storage requirements based on the embedding dimensions you select

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify your API key is correct and has not expired
- Ensure your OpenAI account has billing set up
- Check that the embedding model name is spelled correctly
- For large document collections, consider batching embedding requests

For additional support, refer to the [OpenAI Embeddings documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) or contact PipesHub support.
